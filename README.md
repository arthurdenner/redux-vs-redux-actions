## Goal

This simple project was built to show a coworker the difference between creating actions and reducers with and without [redux-actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/redux-actions), a package with utilities for Redux.

To see the project with `redux-actions`, checkout to the branch named `with-redux-actions`.
