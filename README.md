## Goal

This simple project was created to show a coworker the difference between creating actions and reducers with "barebones Redux", [redux-actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/redux-actions) and [redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-starter-kit), two packages with utilities for Redux.

To see the project with `redux-actions`, checkout to the branch named `with-redux-actions`.

To see the project with `redux-starter-kit`, checkout to the branch named `with-redux-starter-kit`.

Thanks to @acemarke for suggesting an example with `redux-starter-kit`.
